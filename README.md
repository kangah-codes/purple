Purple is a budget and expense tracker mobile app I'm currently building for personal use. I was inspired to build Purple because after I made the switch to Android, I couldn't find a budget app that I liked. I wanted something simple, clean, and easy to use, which was hard to find on Android. So I decided to build my own, and to use this as an opportunity to further polish my React Native skills.

Inspiration for the design was taken from [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/173280263/A-Budget-PLanner-app?tracking_source=search_projects|budget+app&l=24).

### Supported Platforms

Since I'm primarily an android user, Android is my primary target, however since React Native is cross-platform the app should work fairly well on iOS devices as well, however I'm not so worried about optimising for certain iOS devices like the phones without a notch or dynamic islands (8 series and below).

For now Purple is going to work exclusively offline, probably going to use sqlite3 for handling local database operations, once I figure out which direction this project is gonna go I may consider building a backend to allow for online syncing.

### Sample Screens

Here are a few screenshots of the app so far:

</div>

### Building the app

Since this application uses the expo-sdk and is built with React Native, building the app is fairly simple. You can follow the steps below to build the app:

-   Clone the repository
-   cd into the project directory
-   Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies
-   To build for Android, you have to have your Android development environment set up
    -   Run `eas build -p android --profile preview --local --output purple.apk` to build the app for an android target _OR_ you can use the GitHub action provided which builds the apk and creates a new release for it, so you can just download the `.apk` file directly from GitHub.

### Roadmap

Right now, Purple is still just a pet project, I'm not entirely sure I have the direction I want to take it in. But I do have a few ideas in mind:

-   Online accounts sync
-   Golang backend??
-   Web Version?
-   Integration with bank/mobile money services for automatic expense tracking
-   D4RK M0D3 ðŸŒš

### Contributing

I'm not currently looking for contributors since Purple is still in very early stages, but if you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
